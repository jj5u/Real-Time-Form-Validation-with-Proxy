Real-Time Form Validation with Proxy

-   Objective: Build a real-time form validation feature using JavaScript's Proxy object to intercept and validate user input before updating the form's state. The proxy will ensure that certain rules are followed, like a minimum length for a username or proper email format, and provide instant feedback to the user.
-   Features:

*   1. Real-Time Input Validation: Use a Proxy object to validate user input as they type into the form fields (e.g., username, email).
       For example:
    -   Username must be at least 3 characters long.
    -   Email must be in a proper email format.
*   2. Dynamic Styling Feedback: Use CSS to display visual feedback (e.g., green checkmark for valid input, red border for invalid input).

Simple HTML Form: The form will have two input fields (username and email) and provide real-time validation feedback directly in the browser.
